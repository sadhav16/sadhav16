I am a second-year Computer Science student at TKM College of Engineering, passionate about software development and artificial intelligence. With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++, I am eager to apply my skills to real-world projects and gain hands-on experience in the tech industry.

I am particularly interested in exploring the fields of machine learning and data science, as I believe they hold the key to transformative innovations in technology.
